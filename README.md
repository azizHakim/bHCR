# Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition Using CNN
This project is the implementation of the paper- S. M. Azizul Hakim and Asaduzzaman, "Handwritten Bangla Numeral and Basic Character Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network," 2019 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Engineering (ECCE), Cox’sBazar, Bangladesh, 2019, [doi:10.1109/ECACE.2019.8679243](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8679243)

## Built With
* openCV for data preprocessing
* keras on tensorflow backend
* Implemented on Google Colab

## Datasets
BanglaLekha-Isolated is used for train and validation. Some of the images were removed for their ambiguous nature. Prepared test dataset is used for cross-validation.
